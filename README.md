# About

A service that listens to SNS and then breathes fire (notifications) to Slack. 

I'm currently just using it to notify me when my
[partymode](https://github.com/davidmerrick/partymode) service buzzes people into my building,
but it could easily be extended to support many different kinds of notifications that you want to
push from SNS to your Alexa.
